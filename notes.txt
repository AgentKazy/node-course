> Event loop (what makes async processing possible in Node.js)

>> START --> Expired timer callbacks --> I/O (input/output) polling and callbacks --> setImmediate callbacks --> (NOT IMPORTANT) Close callbacks

>> process.nexttick() queue & other microtasks queue (both between phases)

>> Any pending timers or I/O tasks?:
-->  NO --> Exit program
--> YES --> Back to the top of the event loop

>> DON'T BLOCK
- Don't use sync versions of functions in fs, crypto and zlib modules in callbacks
- Don't perform complex calculations (e.g. loops inside loops)
- Be careful with JSON in large objects
- Don't use too complex regular expressions (e.g. nested quantifiers)
